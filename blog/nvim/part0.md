# Hi!
I'm a Neovim user and I like it. As you may know, Neovim is the successor to Vim editor, and you know that once you open Vim, it's [almost impossible] to quit, and I never did.

And in July of 2021, the new 0.5 release of Neovim introduced a lot of stuff, except I managed to miss it all.
The goal of this writing isn't to convince you to use Vim or Neovim, nor to tell you the story about the history of different \*vi\* editors because, honestly, I don't know it myself.
The goal for me is to finally start the journey of new features that Neovim now provides and share them with you.

This story will be split into multiple parts and the first part will be about absolute essentials, how to take your old Vim config and turn it into a modern, 2023-style Neovim config.

# Start
Warn you, I'm a somewhat extreme minimalist, so don't expect anything crazy. The real advantage of post-0.5 Neovim will be covered next, but we need to start somewhere.
Let's get to the code!
