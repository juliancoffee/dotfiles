### About
It is my repo for my dotfiles.<br>
Clone it to ~/.config/dotfiles and edit setup.sh

### Currently in setup.sh
- `fish` config (the most user friendly shell)
- `i3wm` config (because DE are bloated)
- `neovim` config (vim, but better)
- `rofi` config (cool dmenu replacement)
- `most` config (pager that I use for `man`)
- `firefox` user.js (declarative way to set about:config)
- `polybar` config (wm-agnostic X11 bar)
- `mpv` config (the best media player)
- `picom` config (yeah, transparency in the terminal)


### Setup
There is file setup.sh, written for POSIX shell using coreutils as dependency.
