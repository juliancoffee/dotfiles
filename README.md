### About
It is my repo for my dotfiles.

### Currently in setup.sh
- `fish` config (the most user friendly shell)
- `i3wm` config (because DE are bloated)
- `neovim` config (vim, but better)
- `rofi` config (cool dmenu replacement)
- `most` config (pager that I use for `man`)
- `firefox` user.js (declarative way to set about:config)


### Setup
There is file setup.sh, written for POSIX shell using coreutils as dependency.<br>
